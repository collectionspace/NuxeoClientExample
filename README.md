NuxeoClientExample
==================

A simple web app that has an embedded instance of Nuxeo and runs on the latest version of Tomcat.  A value for NUXEO_HOME needs to be set as either an environment variable or as a Java system property.

You can download an archived tomcat deployment folder to test the web app at the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4xvrsse2fmy20u5/apache-tomcat-7.0.57.zip
